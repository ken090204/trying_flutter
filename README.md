# Reflection

*
During our discussion sir I was amazed on how to connect the repository to Github Desktop because it's my first time.Then in the discusion I learned the difference between Git and Github wre Git is the version control while GitHub is the repository.I learned also that Github can create a project were it can colaborate with the group and it can track changes also can shared ideas. After the discusion I realized that its better to use Github than a flashdrive because there is a posibilty that the flashdrive will be corrupted.Lastly, I wanna say thankyou sir because I learned new things and the way you delevered the discussion it was very clear and smooth so thats why I learned a lot from our discusion.
